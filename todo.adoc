= Todo

== Doing

=== Tasks 

* check that we're running as root
* set name on provisioners and sources
* settings: validate jail conf sections (known fileds, types)
* puppet: remove manifest after provision
* start jail using the jail command rather than service
  * so a boot disabled jail can still be started as a one off

=== Bugs

 * Cannot remove a jail with invalid jail.conf (fails on stopping)

=== Refactor

* create a struct for zfs snapshots
* remove dependency on rsync for copying files recursively
* tests and validation for FreeBSD source
* refactor 'update_with_diff'

==== Nice to have

* flag provisioners that require jail to be running and handle when it's not the case.
* rsync provisioner
* pkg upgrade jails
* freebsd-update jails
* ability to split configuration file into 'include' snippets
* detect if provisioner has made changes
* jail resource limits
