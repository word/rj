== doing

* refactor source.rs to work like provisioners

== next up

 * add init sub-command (maybe perhaps)
   ** meaningful error when forgot to init
 * settings: deny unknown fields everywhere
 * settings: validate source name
 * settings: validate provisioner names
 * settings: validation for sources
 * tidy up log messages
 * check config file exists

=== First release

* confirmation before deleting all jails (and -f to force)
* tidy up and tests for main
* pick up config from cwd automatically for self contained set ups

=== Refactoring

* breakout a zfs snapshot into a separate struct
* remove dependency on rsync for copying files recursively
* provisioner tests: create base jail if it doesn't exist

=== Later

* freebsd-update jails
* ability to include config snippets (conf.d style)
* resource limits
* mount additional data sets in jails
