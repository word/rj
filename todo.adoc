= Todo

== doing


== next up

* fail on unknown config options

== backlog

=== First release

* freebsd-update jail
* provision jail
  * shell script
  * puppet
* confirmation before deleting all jails (and -f to force)
* tests for main

=== Later

* config includes or conf.d style include
* parallel operation (create/upgrade etc)
  * need to resurrect ordering

== Done:

* apply config changes
* jail
  * start/stop
  * enable/disable
* create jail.conf
* logger
* cli args
* read config from a toml file
* zfs
  * refactor zfs into a struct
  * set zfs mountpoint: zfs set mountpoint=/jails zroot/jails
  * zfs snapshot method
  * zfs clone method
* try testing commands with mockall

== What makes a jail?

* zfs data set
* jails.conf config entry
* provisioned config (configuration puppet or whatever)
* processes
* network socket
* rc service

* think about config versioning!

== Config layout

/usr/local/etc/rj.conf
/usr/local/etc/rj.conf.d/
